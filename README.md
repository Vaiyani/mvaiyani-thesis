# Thesis

This repo is for the study of master thesis @ TUM. 
It explores the various versions of Transformers, LSTMS and ARIMA to understand which architecture is more robust towards long range dependency modelling for a dataset with no periodicity. The dataset used is the bitcoin dataset from 2017 till 2022.


Beside LTSF-Linear, we provide five significant forecasting Transformers to re-implement the results in the paper.
